# Grendel Post Processing
Here, I wrote scripts using awk, shell, Gnuplot, python and c++ to process the data generated by the grendel package.

## Note
I use bitbucket for the version control as It provides free private repositories. If you want to get full development-history for this code, please email me on mail02ankit@gmail.com.

If you use this code, send me a pizza at mail02ankit@gmail.com
